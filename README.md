# Stephanie Xia's Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website showcasing projects, skills, and blog content. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Project Objective & Inspiration

I've been wanting to code a personal website for a very long time. I knew it was something recruiters looked at when recruiting for jobs. Although I have a resume, I wanted a small space that showed my experiences with a touch of my personality and skill. The website was my canvas to design a unique piece that belonged to me. I was inspired by many examples of students in majors of engineering and computer science for formatting ideas. 

# Project Tools Used

The project is made on VSCode, with coding lagnauges HTML, CSS and Javascript. Hackatime and Waketime was used to help track the amount of time I spent coding. The website is hosted on Github pages and all the code is published onto Github Repo for public view. 

# Project Reflection & Struggles

This website was my first time learning how to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. At first, I was completely lost on where to start. My friend Selena (shoutout to her) helped me set up the basic files and taught me the general structure of html. After that, I watched youtubes teaching me how to code websites. There was a lot of bugs that I didn't know how to fix and sometimes fixing one block of code took an hour. However, as I coded more, I got better at the languages and progress speed up. The most frustrating part would be trying to make the UI look how I wanted it to. Since I didn't have prior experience in making websites, I took inspriation from more than 40+ websites and there was a lot of cool stuff that I couldn't do because of the little experience I had. From this project, I now have a solid understanding of how website making works and I aim to make more projects in the future.
